hairBoot
========

A tiny (<0.5KB) bootloader for STM8S  low-density family 

Usage
-----
1. Flash hairBoot to stm8s: use STVP and ST-LINKï¼Œ burn the bin/hex/out to stm8s
2. Build a app project, get the app bin. 
   Don't forget change app's icf: `define region NearFuncCode = [from 0x8200 to 0x9FFF]`
3. Download app bin to stm8s: 
   write a PC program cooperate with hairBoot or 
   just use stm8 launcher~ (search in chrome apps)

Build
-----
1. Install IAR for stm8, add `xxx\IAR Systems\Embedded workbench 6.5\stm8\bin` to Environment var Path
2. Run make.bat to get bin, run out2hex to get hex
3. fix all interrupt vectors except the vecter 0.
   change vector n to 0x82008200 + 4*n, eg vector 1: 82008204
4. finished! you get the bin/hex/out now~

Important notes
----------------
1. Programming the flash on STM8S device is only possible is the UBC (User Boot Code)
   is not locked.  This is controller in option bits.
2. hairBoot provides a mechanism to lock the UBC.
   Reboot the STM8S
   Write command BOOT_LOCK_UBC (0xaa)
   Write 8-bit value to write to UBC Option Byte (OPT->OPT1).
   (Value indicates number of 64-byte pages locked, starting from 0x8000)
3. A locked devices can be unlocked by writing 0 to UBC.
   Another option, using IAR, connect to the device without downloading the code,
   In 'Option Bytes', right click UBC and unprotect the memory.
